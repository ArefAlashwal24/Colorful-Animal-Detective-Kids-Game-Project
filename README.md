# Colorful Animal Detective – Kids’ Web Game

An educational web game designed for 5–6-year-old children who cannot yet read.  
The game focuses on simple interaction, color recognition, and basic problem-solving through character selection, a color “code” puzzle, and a coloring activity.

This project was developed for the course **“Yazılım Gerçekleştirme ve Testi”** under the supervision of **Dr. Nurettin Şenyer** and **Ömer Durmuş**.

Development Notes
The initial version of the game was generated using Google AI Studio from a detailed prompt describing all screens and interactions.

The generated code was then:

Cleaned up and commented,

Adjusted for mobile usability (larger tap areas, spacing),

Extended with feedback animations and reset functionality.

Testing
The project includes basic testing activities:

Manual functional tests for each screen:

Navigation (home → character → story → puzzle → coloring → finish)

Correct/incorrect color sequences

Coloring, reset, replay

Cross-browser checks on Chrome and Edge.

Informal user testing with people simulating the 5–6 age group to verify that the game can be used without reading.

Course Contribution
This project contributes to “Yazılım Gerçekleştirme ve Testi” by:

Implementing a complete, working web application from requirements to deployment.

Combining AI-assisted development with manual coding and debugging.

Using Git and GitHub for version control and GitHub Pages for release.

Applying basic software testing and iterative improvement on a real product.
